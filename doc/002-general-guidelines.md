## General Guidelines

### Sample code for common scenarios

#### Pulling an image
```clojure
(def images-docker (c/client {:engine   :docker
                              :category :images
                              :version  "v1.41"
                              :conn     {:uri "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"}}))

(c/invoke images-docker {:op     :ImageCreate
                         :params {:fromImage "busybox:musl"}})
```

#### Creating a container
```clojure
(def containers-docker (c/client {:engine :docker
                                  :category :containers
                                  :conn     {:uri "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
                                  :version  "v1.41"}}))

(c/invoke containers-docker {:op     :ContainerCreate
                             :params {:name "conny"}
                             :data   {:Image "busybox:musl"
                                      :Cmd   ["sh"
                                              "-c"
                                              "i=1; while :; do echo $i; sleep 1; i=$((i+1)); done"]}})
```

#### Starting a container
```clojure
(c/invoke containers-docker {:op     :ContainerStart
                             :params {:id "conny"}})
```

#### Creating a network
```clojure
(def networks-docker (c/client {:engine   :docker
                                :category :networks
                                :conn     {:uri "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"}
                                :version  "v1.41"}))

(c/invoke networks-docker {:op   :NetworkCreate
                           :data {:Name "conny-network"}})
```

#### Streaming logs
```clojure
; fn to react when data is available
(defn react-to-stream
  [stream reaction-fn]
  (future
    (with-open [rdr (clojure.java.io/reader stream)]
      (loop [r (java.io.BufferedReader. rdr)]
        (when-let [line (.readLine r)]
          (reaction-fn line)
          (recur r))))))

(def log-stream (c/invoke containers-docker {:op     :ContainerLogs
                                             :params {:id     "conny"
                                                      :follow true
                                                      :stdout true}
                                             :as     :stream}))

(react-to-stream log-stream println) ; prints the logs line by line when they come.
```

#### Attach to a container and send data to stdin
*Note:* `:as :socket` applies only to the JVM runtime.
```clojure
;; This is a raw bidirectional java.net.Socket, so both reads and writes are possible.
;; conny-reader has been started with: docker run -d -i --name conny-reader alpine:latest sh -c "cat - >/out"
(def sock (c/invoke containers {:op     :ContainerAttach
                                :params {:id     "conny-reader"
                                         :stream true
                                         :stdin  true}
                                :as     :socket}))

(clojure.java.io/copy "hello" (.getOutputStream sock))

(.close sock) ; Important for freeing up resources.
```

#### Using registries that need authentication
Thanks [@AustinC](https://github.com/AustinC) for this example.

```clojure
(ns dclj.core
  (:require [contajners.core :as c]
            [cheshire.core :as json])
  (:import [java.util Base64]))

(defn b64-encode
  [to-encode]
  (.encodeToString (Base64/getEncoder) (.getBytes to-encode)))

(def auth
  (-> {"username"      "un"
       "password"      "pw"
       "serveraddress" "docker.acme.com"}
      json/encode
      b64-encode))

(def images
  (c/client {:engine   :docker
             :category :images
             :conn     {:uri "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"}
             :version  "v1.41"}))

(c/invoke images
          {:op               :ImageCreate
           :params           {:fromImage       "docker.acme.com/eg:2.1.995"
                              :X-Registry-Auth auth}
           :throw-exceptions true})
```

#### HTTPS and Mutual TLS(mTLS)

Since both https and unix sockets are suppported, and generally docker deamons exposed over HTTPS are protected via [mTLS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/protect-access/#use-tls-https-to-protect-the-docker-daemon-socket), here is an example using mTLS to connect to docker via HTTPS:

```clojure
;; Create a client using https
;; The ca.pem, key.pem and cert.pem are produced by the docker daemon when protected via mTLS
(def http-tls-ping
  (c/client {:category :_ping
             :engine   :docker
             :version  "v1.41"
             :conn     {:uri  "https://my.remote.docker.host:8000"
                        :mtls {:ca   "ca.pem"
                               :key  "key.pem"
                               :cert "cert.pem"}}}))

(invoke http-tls-ping {:op :SystemPing}) ;; => Returns "OK"
```

The caveat here is _password protected PEM files aren't supported yet_. Please raise an issue if there is a need for it.

### Not so common scenarios

#### Accessing undocumented/experimental APIs
There are some cases where you may need access to an API that is either experimental or is not in the swagger docs.
Docker [checkpoint](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/checkpoint/) is one such example. Thanks [@mk](https://github.com/mk) for bringing it up!

Since this uses the published APIs from the swagger spec, the way to access them is to use the lower level fn `request` from either the `contajners.jvm-runtime` or `contajners.sci-runtime` ns. The caveat is the **response will be totally raw(data, stream or the socket itself)**.

**Warning**: fns from the `impl` and `rt` ns are not guaranteed to have a stable API as they are internal.

client method path headers query-params body as throw-exceptions throw-entire-message

`request` takes the following params as a map:
- client: the connection. Required.
- path: the relative path to the operation. Required.
- method: the method of the HTTP request as a keyword. Required.
- query-params: the map of key-values to be passed as query params.
- header: the map of key-values to be passed as HEADER params.
- body: the stream or map(will be converted to JSON) to be passed as body.
- as: takes the kind of response expected. One of :stream, :socket or :data. Same as `invoke`. Default: `:data`.
- throw-exceptions: Throws exceptions when status is >= 400 for API calls. Default: false.
- throw-entire-message: Includes the full exception as a string. Default: false.

```clojure
(require
  #?(:bb '[contajners.sci-runtime :as rt]
     :clj '[contajners.jvm-runtime :as rt]))

;; This is the undocumented API in the Docker Daemon.
;; See https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/22049/files#diff-8038ade87553e3a654366edca850f83dR11
(rt/request {:client (rt/client "unix:///var/run/docker.sock" {})
             :path   "/v1.41/containers/conny/checkpoints"
             :method :get})
```

More examples of low level calls:
```clojure
;; Ping the server
(rt/request {:client (rt/client "unix:///var/run/docker.sock" {})
             :path   "/v1.41/_ping"
             :method :get})

;; Copy a folder to a container
(rt/request {:client (rt/client "unix:///var/run/docker.sock" {})
             :method :put
             :path   "/v1.41/containers/conny/archive"
             :query-params  {:path "/root/src"}
             :body   (-> "src.tar.gz"
                          io/file
                          io/input-stream)})
```

#### Reading a streaming output in case of an exception being thrown

When `:throw-exceptions` is passed as `true` and the `:as` is set to `:stream`, to read the response stream, pass `throw-entire-message` as `true` to the invoke. The stream is available as `:body` in the ex-data of the exception. `throw-entire-message` is only applicable to the JVM runtime.
```clojure
(try
  (invoke containers-docker
          {:op                    :ContainerArchive
           :params                {:id   "conny"
                                   :path "/this-does-not-exist"}
           :as                    :stream
           :throw-exceptions      true
           :throw-entire-message  true})
  (catch Exception e
    (-> e ex-data :body slurp println))) ; Prints out the body of error from docker.
```

And anything else is possible!

### Adding support for a new container engine

contajners has been designed keeping in mind that support for newer and upcoming engines should be simple enough to add. The only requirement from the engine is that it must expose a REST API and has some form of Swagger/OpenAPI docs available.

Currently only Swagger 2.0 parsing is there as thats whats necessary now however its easy to add support for OpenAPI 3.0+. Please raise an issue when necessary.

- Clone the repository
- Navigate to `fetch_api/main.clj`
- In the `sources` map add the name of the engine as a key
  - For the value, add the `:url` template from where the api yaml can be downloaded
  - add the `doc-url` template where the doc of a version and OperationId can be seen
  - add the list of available `:versions` which would be used in the template urls
- You can add an optional `:namespace` which makes the category available namespaced, for example `:libpod/containers` for podman and `:containers` for docker. This is useful for APIs exposing similar functionality but are compatible with other engines. Like Podman is with the Docker API.
- Run `clojure -X:fetch_api` from the root of the repo to download and parse all the APIs into the optimized edn files in `resources/contajners/<the engine name>/<version>.edn`
- When creating the client with `contajners.core/client` the new engine should be available and can pass it as `:the engine name` as a keyword. Similarly `contajners.core/categories` should work as well
- Also consider contributing it back here, we all would LOVE to use _that shiny new engine_ üòç
